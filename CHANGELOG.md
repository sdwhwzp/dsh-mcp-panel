# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [0.6.16] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- **The approval gate no longer reads the session event log.** `writePatch` decided whether to route a profile write through `ctx.approval` by scanning the session's events for `turn/start`/`turn/end` through the synchronous event-snapshot read, which the 0.1.6 line marks `@deprecated` ("new calls are prohibited"). It now reads the published `agent.status === 'running'`; the approval seam must still be present, so a host without it falls back to the explicit UI confirmation path instead of silently treating the write as pre-approved. Regression tests cover running (asks), idle (never asks), and unbound-agent (never asks).

- **The panel's "current session" works again where `SessionListState.current` was removed.** The client read `getSnapshot().current` through a structural cast, which returned `undefined` on the 0.1.6 line and left the panel without a current session; the id is now derived from the per-session retention facts (`retainedBy.mainView > 0`, the upstream `ui-session` pattern), with the legacy field still winning where a host publishes it.

- **Panel styles survive a remount.** The stylesheet installer returned an empty disposer when the `<style>` element already existed, so unmounting the first of two live mounts pulled the sheet out from under the survivor and orphaned the node. Installations are now counted: any live install keeps the element, and only the last disposer removes it (idempotent).

- **A disposed mount no longer registers into a dead fiber.** Mounting the service opens an await window inside `apply`; the status listener, `/mcp` command and probe tool are now registered only when the fiber survived that await (A02).

### Changed

- Declare `dsh.manifestVersion: 1` and the canonical three-clause `engines.dsh` (G-3).
- **Canary duty (this is the family's only canary repo):** the dev/test pins moved to `0.1.6-alpha.2` and both typecheck rulers are green on that face. No new errors surfaced from the raise, so there is no canary warning to forward to the other 31 repositories this round.

## [0.6.15] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- **Issue #27 — `disable` / `enable` / `edit` emitted `- set:` fragments the loader dialect does not implement (silent no-op).** Both renderers (`renderPatchFragment` and the `/mcp <server> disable|enable` suggestion) now emit the loader's real dialect: `- id: <entryId>` + `name:` + `disabled:` (or a full `config:` block for edits). `appendPatchFragment` reads the file back to confirm the appended block survived, and `writePatch` re-verifies every write against the loader's re-applied state before reporting success — a skipped patch (wrong dialect, a row living in a layer a profile patch cannot reach such as `$DSH_HOME/cordis.patch.yml`, or a name mismatch) now fails honestly instead of reading "written". New config: `writeVerifyEnabled` (default true) and `writeVerifyTimeoutMs` (default 3000).

### Added

- **Read-only Resources browser.** The shipped `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-resources` service now bridges MCP resources upstream; the console feature-detects the service + the three registered shared tools and offers list / templates / URI read per server card through the OFFICIAL tool pipeline (results stay panel-only). `callTool` now accepts the three shared resource tools and injects the requested `server` into their arguments (conflicts fail closed). Capability detection no longer probes the never-shipped `mcpCatalog` face; Prompts stays `available: false` until upstream bridges prompt templates.

### Changed

- Compatibility baseline raised to `dsh-v0.1.6-alpha.1`: all `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` dev/test pins and the runtime `dsh-subprocess` pin moved to `0.1.6-alpha.1`; `dshWorkshop.compatibility.dshVersions` gains `0.1.6-alpha.1`; the five-language READMEs now document the id-override CRUD dialect, the Resources browser, the write-verification hardening, and the corrected capabilities wording (Prompts + resource subscriptions pending).

## [0.6.14] - 2026-09-12

### Changed

- Rename the four translated READMEs to `README-<lang>.md`. npm selects the package-page readme as the first markdown file matching its `{README,README.*}` glob (`@npmcli/package-json`, publish path), and that glob order puts `README.<lang>.md` ahead of `README.md` — so npm was serving the Simplified-Chinese file for this package too (measured on 15/15 sampled packages of the family). The new names sit outside the glob, so the English source is served again. No content changed apart from the language-switcher link each translation holds to its siblings, and the repo readme gate still passes. Takes effect with the next release; an already-published version cannot gain a corrected readme retroactively.
- Pin the `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` dev/test dependencies to the published `0.1.5-rc.2` line and record `0.1.5-rc.2` in `dshWorkshop.compatibility.dshVersions`; the monthly Compat workflow now runs against `0.1.5-rc.2`. The peer range `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0 || >=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0` is unchanged, so no supported host line is dropped.

## [0.6.13] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- Bump the runtime `zod` range from `^4.4.3` to `^4.5.4` (dependabot #19), which had been merged without a release.
- Bump the build toolchain to `tsdown@0.23` (dependabot #24) and the test toolchain to `vitest@5` together with its matching `@vitest/coverage-v8@5` (#25). `vitest` and `@vitest/coverage-v8` must move in lockstep: vitest 5 changed the coverage payload contract, so leaving the provider at `4.1.10` crashed `pnpm run test:coverage` with `Expected string coverage payload, received object`.

## [0.6.12] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- Pin the `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` dev/test dependencies to the published `0.1.5-rc.1` line and record `0.1.5-rc.1` in `dshWorkshop.compatibility.dshVersions`; the monthly Compat workflow now runs against `0.1.5-rc.1`. The peer range `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0 || >=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0` is unchanged, so no supported host line is dropped.

### Docs

- Refresh the five-language README compatibility baseline to `dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1` (verified 2026-09-10).

## [0.6.11] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- Align the runtime `@deepseek-ai/dsh-subprocess` pin to `0.1.5-alpha.1` (it was still `0.1.2-rc.1` while the dev/test line had already moved to `0.1.5-alpha.1`): a pinned rc.1 runtime dependency shadows the host's own `0.1.5-alpha.1` tree when the tarball is installed into a `0.1.5-alpha.1` profile, so the stdio probe could resolve the wrong `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` generation. The package stays a regular `dependencies` entry — `src/probe.ts` value-imports `scrubbedParentEnv` at runtime, so consumers really install it — and no peer range changes.

## [0.6.10] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- Align the `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` peer ranges to `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0 || >=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0` and pin the dev/test dependencies to the published `0.1.5-alpha.1` line: adaptation to DeepSeek Harness `dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.1` (session format V3, `ctx.agent` removal, `Inbox` type-only interface); runtime behavior is unchanged for every supported host line.
- Record `0.1.5-alpha.1` in `dshWorkshop.compatibility.dshVersions`.

### Docs

- Refresh the five-language README compatibility baseline to `dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.1` (verified 2026-09-09).

## [0.6.9] - 2026-09-07

### Docs

- Fix the DSH plugin badge URL: shields.io rejects the four-segment static badge form with "404 badge not found"; the label now uses the documented double-dash form (`dsh--plugin`), rendering identically; no behavior change.

## [0.6.8] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- Align the `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` peer ranges to `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0`: the older `>=0.1.0-rc.8 <0.2.0` band resolved to only the `0.1.0-rc.8` prerelease under registry-driven resolution and broke fresh tarball installs; no behavior change.

### Docs

- Refresh the five-language README support-version wording: the verified GitHub tag `dsh-v0.1.3-alpha.1` now leads the compatibility claim, while npm `0.1.2-rc.1` stays the published dependency-pin line (peers `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0`); no behavior change.


## [0.6.7] - 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Align the devDependency pins and the runtime `@deepseek-ai/dsh-subprocess` pin to the published dsh `0.1.2-rc.1` line, move the compat CI probes from the stale `0.1.2-alpha.3` pins to `0.1.2-rc.1`, and correct the `mcp/status` upstream-seam wording (proposed, not yet shipped — feature-detected); no behavior change.

## [0.6.6] - 2026-09-03

### Changed

- Runtime `dependencies` entry `@deepseek-ai/dsh-subprocess` moved from `0.1.1-rc.2` to the published `0.1.2-alpha.5` line.
- Dev pins `@deepseek-ai/cordis-plugin-loader ^1.0.3` / `@deepseek-ai/cordis-plugin-include ^1.0.7` aligned with the `cordis 4.0.2` peer ranges.

## [0.6.5] - 2026-09-02

### Docs

- Sync the five-language READMEs to the 0.1.2-alpha.5 facts; no behavior change.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-09-02

### Changed

- Align the devDependency pins to the published dsh 0.1.2-alpha.5 line and re-verify the adaptation claims; no behavior change.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- Align the devDependency pins to the published dsh `0.1.2-alpha.3` line (11 `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` packages), align `cordis`/`schemastery` to `^4.0.2`/`^3.18.2`, and raise the compat probe pins to `0.1.2-alpha.3`. No behavior change; the five-language READMEs record the alpha.3 fact.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed

- Client half: `ClientContext` now aliases `@deepseek-ai/cordis` `Context`,
  the `remote` service contract comes from
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-api-remotes/client`, and the slots registry is read
  through a local structural contract — the browser bundle no longer imports
  the removed `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-runtime` and mounts again on harness
  lines without the client runtime package.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- Declare the web-client inject packages (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-connection`,
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-locale`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-runtime`,
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-settings`) as optional peerDependencies so the
  bundle composition is explicit and standalone installs stay clean.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Recommended MCP server catalog plus configuration JSON import/export.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-08-22

### Changed

- All `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` dependencies moved from the `0.1.0-rc.8` line to `0.1.1-rc.2`: the 15 devDependencies pin `0.1.1-rc.2` exactly, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-subprocess` (the one runtime dependency) pins `0.1.1-rc.2`, and the four peerDependencies (`dsh-commands` / `dsh-jobs` / `dsh-tools` / `dsh-typert-protocol`) keep their `>=0.1.0-rc.8 <0.2.0` range (no rc.2-exclusive API is used). `@deepseek-ai/cordis` and the non-dsh dependency lines are unchanged; the compatibility tables now claim `0.1.1-rc.2`–`0.2.0`, and the compat workflow pins the harness CLI and base/headless bundles to `0.1.1-rc.2`.
- The `/mcp` and `mcp_probe` surfaces are unchanged: rc.2 keeps the `commands.execute(agent, line, images, signal)` signature and the single-`CommandInvocation` handler shape this package already drives, so no call-site edits were needed.

### Engineering

- `pnpm-lock.yaml` regenerated against the rc.2 graph; `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` collapses the stale per-package rc.6 list to a single `@deepseek-ai/*` wildcard so fresh harness releases install without a release-age delay.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- `mcp_probe`, the panel probe action, `/mcp <server> probe`, and the passive probe now support **stdio** MCP servers: a probe on a stdio row spawns the configured `command`/`args` under the same `scrubbedParentEnv` base the mcp-client bridge uses (credential-shaped and `DSH_*` names never leak into the child implicitly) plus the row's explicit `env`/`cwd`, completes one MCP `initialize` handshake over stdin/stdout, and records the sanitized server name/version or a sanitized failure detail — still panel-only, with the same unowned-job semantics (cancel, per-probe timeout, display cap). `ProbeTarget` is now a `kind`-discriminated union (`http` | `stdio`) resolved by `McpPanelService.probeSpec`; streamable-http rows are probed exactly as before.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-08-21

### Changed

- All `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` dependencies moved from the `0.1.0-rc.6` line to rc.8: the 15 devDependencies pin `0.1.0-rc.8` exactly, and the four peerDependencies (`dsh-commands` / `dsh-jobs` / `dsh-tools` / `dsh-typert-protocol`) now range `>=0.1.0-rc.8 <0.2.0`. `@deepseek-ai/cordis` and the non-dsh dependency lines are unchanged; the compatibility tables now claim `0.1.0-rc.8`–`0.2.0`.
- The `/mcp` and `mcp_probe` surfaces are unchanged. The rc.8 `commands.execute(agent, line, images, signal)` signature carries a new image-attachment parameter; the internal call sites that drive plain invocations (test harness, loader runner, headless verifier) now pass an empty image list.

### Engineering

- `pnpm-lock.yaml` regenerated against the rc.8 graph so the client type faces (`dsh-typert-protocol`, `dsh-api-remotes`) resolve as one version, keeping the `mcpPanel` Remote namespace merge visible to `typecheck:ci`.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed

- The trial console's callId counter now lives on a per-service-instance trial caller (`createTrialCaller`) instead of a module-level `let`, matching its documented per-instance semantics — a plugin reload no longer carries counter state across mounts. (`runTrialCall` is now exported through the caller factory.)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- **MCP management console** (the official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client` stays the only bridge; this plugin is now its full experience layer):
  - **Server CRUD in the Settings tab**: add/edit/remove servers through a visual form (stdio and streamable-http shapes); every edit renders as an APPEND-ONLY `cordis.patch.yml` operation (`insert` / `set` / `set disabled: true` — the patch vocabulary has no remove, so removal disables the row and keeps it re-enableable). One-click copy, or approval-gated write: the host asks `ctx.approval` when an agent with an open turn exists, otherwise the explicit interactive confirmation is the approval channel; every write first copies the file to a timestamped backup and prunes to the newest `backupCount`.
  - **Tool trial console**: pick a server → registered `mcp__*` tools → JSON arguments → call through the OFFICIAL `ctx.tools.execute()` pipeline (pre-execute permission policy, approval asks, guards, and post-execute all stay in force). Results show the canonical JSON value plus the rendered content, capped by `trialMaxResultChars`; panel-only, never model context. `/mcp <server> call <tool> [json]` exposes the same pipeline to the model with approval routed through the command's agent.
  - **Health diagnostics**: `/mcp <server> health` and per-card suggestion lists derived from sanitized error text (ENOENT → dependency missing, ECONNREFUSED, ETIMEDOUT, 401/403/404, DNS, rate limit, reconnect exhaustion, failed fiber). Child exit codes / stderr tails are honestly labeled "pending upstream support" until the official client exposes them (proposed in the harness `docs/upstream-proposal.md`).
  - **Capabilities board**: Resources/Prompts availability is feature-detected against a proposed upstream catalog seam; today the console clearly labels both "pending upstream support" (the official client bridges tools only).
- Config: `trialEnabled` / `trialTimeoutMs` / `trialMaxResultChars` / `writeEnabled` (kill switch) / `backupCount`, all with Schemastery schema, fail-loud bounds, and explicit `resolveConfig` re-validation.
- The panel injects NO prompt sections; the only model-facing text it adds remains the two tool/command descriptions.

### Changed

- The snapshot now carries sanitized per-server config views (env/header VALUES never leave the host — keys only, with keep-semantics re-merge for edits), derived diagnostics, and the trial/write policy; the upstream seam consumption now also carries the proposed `exitCode`/`stderrTail` fields when present.
- `/mcp` usage now documents `call` and `health`; the command output stays model-readable and log-reconstructable.
- Sanitization rules unchanged and extended over the new surfaces: fragment previews never contain `!!js` expressions and never echo secret values.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- Panel at a glance: a summary line above the cards (total servers, connected, with errors — counted from the same badge codes the rows show), a server search box that filters cards by name or target, and expand-all / collapse-all buttons (multi-card expansion replaces the single-open accordion).
- Release pipeline: `scripts/release.mjs` (version bump + changelog stamp + full gate + commit + annotated tag, with revert on failure), `scripts/check-tag-version.mjs` (tag/version tripwire for CI), `scripts/changelog-section.mjs` (prints one version's changelog section), and the tag-triggered `release` workflow — gate again → npm publish with provenance → GitHub Release with the packed tarball attached and notes from the changelog.
- Package metadata: `homepage`, `bugs`, and `author` fields.

### Changed

- The dependency line actually lands: typescript 7.0.2 (the TS7 build the tsconfigs were already prepared for), vitest 4.1.10, jsdom 30.0.1 — the full gate suite stays green. The 0.2.1 changelog had claimed these bumps prematurely; that claim is removed from the 0.2.1 entry.

### Engineering

- 109 tests (up from 105): summary counting, server-filter matching, and their agreement with badge derivation.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- CI never passed: `pnpm/action-setup` had no pnpm version to install (no `packageManager` field and no `version` input). Added `packageManager: pnpm@11.7.0`, upgraded the actions (checkout@v7, setup-node@v7, pnpm/action-setup@v6), and pinned the pnpm version explicitly in `compat.yml` (its subdirectory checkout has no workspace-root `package.json` to auto-detect from).
- Probe targeting for rows nested under loader groups: `rawEndpoint` compared the group-composed `entry.id` (`include:…`) against the snapshot namespace derived from `entry.options.id`, so group-nested rows without an explicit `serverName` could never be probed.
- Upstream `mcp/status` payloads are validated before storage — a malformed payload (unknown phase, non-numeric counts) previously flowed into the snapshot verbatim and got the whole `mcpPanel/status` response rejected by the strict Typert codec on the client.
- Reconnect counting is idempotent per observed attempt: re-observing the same payload (HMR remount, event + query seed) no longer double counts; `connected`/`disposed` resets the counter so the next outage counts from attempt 1.
- `/mcp <server> disable|enable` on a leftover (unconfigured) `mcp__` namespace emitted a malformed `- set: { id: , … }` suggestion — it now refuses with a localized explanation, and listings mark those rows `unconfigured` instead of `disabled`.
- Job lifecycle states outside the panel vocabulary render as `unknown` (muted) instead of failing the wire codec or throwing at render.
- Repaired mojibake (corrupted em-dashes/arrows) in `docs/upstream-proposal.md`; its status header now points at the implemented fork branch and the Discussions handoff.

### Changed

- The tab polls on a short cadence while any probe is running, so probe rows and the disabled probe button settle even when `refreshIntervalMs` is `0`.
- The tab's error state now shows the underlying failure message instead of a generic notice.
- Badges no longer double-announce to screen readers (dropped `role="img"`/`aria-label`; the label is visible text).
- The `/mcp` command hint is served from the localized message dictionaries.

### Engineering

- tsdown config migrated off the deprecated `external`/`noExternal` options to `deps.neverBundle`/`deps.alwaysBundle`/`deps.onlyBundle`.
- Removed `baseUrl` from the tsconfigs (dropped in TypeScript 7; `paths` resolves relative to the config file), unblocking the typescript@7 line.
- `files` now ships `docs/`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, and all five READMEs (the published tarball was missing `docs/upstream-proposal.md`, which the READMEs link to).
- 105 tests (up from 96): observation validation and idempotent reconnect counting, nested-row probe targeting, leftover-namespace command behavior, and unknown job-state presentation.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Panel probe action (`mcpPanel/probe`): one-click connectivity probe of one streamable-http server from the settings tab; results stay panel-only.
- Passive background probes (`passiveProbeEnabled` / `passiveProbeIntervalMs`) with per-server reachability badges kept separate from connection status.
- Suggested panel polling (`refreshIntervalMs`); the tab refreshes automatically on the suggested interval.
- `/mcp` output language (`outputLanguage: 'en' | 'zh' | 'es' | 'pt' | 'hi'`); renderers parameterized on a message dictionary, patch lines stay machine-identical.
- Probe record cap (`maxProbes`) and upstream event freshness (`observedAt` → "last event Ns ago").
- `/mcp <server> probe` command action: start a panel-only probe from the command surface.
- Panel detail row for config-declared policy facts (`configuredNote`: reconnect budget, fail-fast, tool timeout).
- Probe rows show local start/end wall-clock times; the probe button disables while a probe for that server is running.
- Panel polish: focus-visible rings, attempt x/y budget row, bounded server-info display in probe details.

### Changed

- Tool filter input is now per-card: one query per expanded server, no cross-card leakage.
- Polling pauses while the document is hidden and refreshes on visibility regain.
- URL fragment credentials (`#token=…`) are redacted like query credentials, in URLs and free text.
- Leftover (unconfigured) `mcp__` namespaces badge as "unknown" instead of "disabled".
- The settings tab keeps following the app UI language (en/zh — the harness locale face supports those two codes today); the `/mcp` command language is the separate five-language `outputLanguage` config.

### Engineering

- `.gitattributes` pins LF line endings so Windows checkouts stop producing CRLF diff noise.
- Version-consistency tripwire: the probe's MCP `clientInfo.version` must equal the package version.
- CI restores typecheck: `typecheck:ci` resolves the npm-published `0.1.0-rc.6` type faces (new client-* devDeps, no checkout paths); CI matrix runs Node 22 + 24 on Ubuntu + Windows.
- Monthly harness-compat job (`.github/workflows/compat.yml`): packs the plugin, installs it into a fresh web profile of a pinned deepseek-harness SHA, and boots it end to end.
- `scripts/verify-headless.mjs` now replicates the launcher's `prepareProfile` steps (flat module fallback heal, empty root-config write) and locates the installation anchor by walking up (plus `DSH_INSTALL_ANCHOR` override) — it works for plugin repos checked out at any depth under the harness.
- Upstream `mcp/status` seam: implemented in a deepseek-harness branch (`feat/mcp-client-status-observability-seam`) with tests, docs, and an Agent Note; the panel consumes it unchanged — verified end to end with a real `server-everything` row reporting `status: connected (source: upstream-event)`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-14

Initial release.

### Added

- Read-only MCP management panel for the official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client`:
  - `/mcp` command (list, per-server detail, `tools`, controlled `disable`/`enable` patch suggestions), model-readable and session-log reconstructable.
  - Settings → Plugins → **MCP** tab (panel-only snapshot over the `mcpPanel` Typert Remote namespace): transport/target, status badges, tool inventory, sanitized errors, reconnect counts, probe results.
  - `mcp_probe` one-shot Streamable HTTP connectivity probe (background job, panel-only results).
  - Display sanitization (URL query credentials, userinfo passwords, header values, bearer tokens, JWTs, env-var credentials).
  - Consumption of the proposed upstream `mcp/status` seam (typed event + query service, feature-detected; honest `unknown`/`derived` fallback).
- Hand-written `./typert` host manifest + client Remote contribution sharing one canonical descriptor.
- 58 unit tests; headless verification script; Apache-2.0; five-language READMEs.

### Verified

- Against a source checkout of deepseek-harness (workspace packages `0.1.0-rc.5`, mainline `7b9644f`): headless `/mcp` end-to-end (13 real tools enumerated), live web profile (gateway RPC, client bundle, boot manifest).
