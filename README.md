## Compatibility

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| Harness | DeepSeek Harness `dsh-v0.1.6-alpha.2` (verified 2026-09-18): dual typecheck rulers green on the `0.1.6-alpha.2` dev/test face (this repo is the family's canary — no new errors surfaced), 174 tests, and the full gate chain (typecheck / typecheck:ci / test / build / verify / package). The `writePatch` re-verification assertion stands on this line. Previous baseline: `dsh-v0.1.6-alpha.1` (verified 2026-09-16). |
| Node | `^22.19.0 \|\| >=24.0.0` |
| Platforms | Web GUI (dual-face: host + browser) |
| Model | Any (the panel is read-only; only `/mcp` output is model-readable) |

## What you get

`dsh-mcp-panel` is the experience layer on top of the official MCP client: a read-only runtime view plus safe, reversible profile writes.

- **`/mcp` command** — one row per server: transport, target, tool count, connection status (from the upstream seam; `unknown` when unobserved), last error, reconnect count — model-readable, session-log reconstructable, five output languages.
- **`/mcp <server> tools`** — model-visible `mcp__*` tool names and descriptions.
- **`/mcp <server> health`** — derived self-heal suggestions (ENOENT → missing dependency, ECONNREFUSED, timeouts, 401/403/404, DNS, rate limit, reconnect exhaustion…); exit code / stderr tail honestly labeled *pending upstream support* until the client exposes them.
- **`/mcp <server> disable` / `enable`** — turn one server row off or back on without editing the profile patch by hand.
- **`/mcp <server> probe`** — one Streamable HTTP connectivity probe for that server (background job).
- **`/mcp <server> call <tool> [json]`** — trial-call through the **official tool pipeline** (`ctx.tools.execute()`); pre-execute permission policy, approval, guards, and post-execute all apply.
- **Settings → Plugins → MCP tab** — status cards with badges, diagnostics, and probes, plus the server CRUD and the tool trial console.
- **Server CRUD** — add/edit/remove forms → `insert` for add and id-targeted overrides (`- id:` + `name:` + `disabled:`/`config:`) for edit/remove → clipboard copy or approval-gated write with automatic backups and loader re-verification.
- **Resources browse** — read-only resource listing, template listing, and URI reads through the official `list_mcp_resources` / `list_mcp_resource_templates` / `read_mcp_resource` tools (bridged by the shipped `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-resources` service); results are shown in the tab only, never in model context.
- **Recommended directory** — a built-in community MCP server catalog (filesystem, git, github, fetch, playwright, …) served in the snapshot; `catalogEntries` appends/overrides entries, and `catalogToConfigInput` turns one into a one-click add.
- **Config import/export** — `exportConfigs()` serializes the server rows to a versioned JSON document (a `!!js` row exports as `null` with a reason), and `importPreview()` parses an export back into per-server `add` patch fragments for review.
- **Tool trial console** — server → `mcp__*` tool → JSON args → canonical JSON result + rendered content; capped by `trialMaxResultChars`; panel-only, never model context.

## Architecture: official client = bridge, this plugin = console

[`@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client`](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/tree/master/packages/mcp/mcp-client) is the **only bridge**: one plugin instance per MCP server, configured as a hand-written `cordis.yml` row, connecting the transport, syncing tools, and registering `mcp__<server>__<tool>` names. This plugin never replaces it — it is the **experience layer on top**:

```text

```

The console **reads** the client through its proposed `mcp/status` observability seam (not yet shipped upstream; feature-detected) (event + `mcpStatus` query service), the tool registry, and the loader; it **writes** only the profile's patch layer — append-only, approval-gated, always backed up. Transport, OAuth, and protocol stay untouched.

## Console vs. hand-written cordis.yml

| | Hand-written cordis.yml | dsh-mcp-panel console |
|---|---|---|
| Add a server | Edit YAML, mind indent/quoting | Form → patch fragment → **copy** or **write** (approval + auto backup) |
| Edit a server | Edit YAML, restart/hot-reload | Form pre-filled from the live row; unchanged secrets keep their raw values host-side |
| Remove a server | Delete the row | `- id:` + `disabled: true` override (the patch vocabulary has no remove) — re-enableable anytime |
| See status | Read logs | Badges + reconnects + last error, live from the `mcp/status` seam |
| Try a tool | Ask the model to call it | Trial console → official `ctx.tools.execute()` pipeline (permission & approval stay in force) |
| Diagnose failures | Grep logs | `/mcp <server> health` with derived self-heal suggestions |
| Mistakes | Manual revert | Every write is append-only and leaves a timestamped backup |

The console's output IS `cordis.patch.yml` vocabulary — the same lines you would write by hand, generated, previewed, and applied safely.

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. install the bundle into your profile
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:PerryLink/dsh-mcp-panel#main"

# or from npm (published releases)
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-mcp-panel

# 2. restart and verify the row
dsh --profile web --dump-config | grep -A3 'id: mcp-panel'
```

Then open **Settings → Plugins → MCP**, or run:

```text
/mcp
/mcp everything tools
/mcp everything health
/mcp everything call echo '{"message": "hi"}'
```

## Install & uninstall

- **git channel** (latest `main`): `dsh plugin --profile web add "github:PerryLink/dsh-mcp-panel#main"` — the `prepare` script builds with production dependencies only.
- **npm channel** (published releases): `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-mcp-panel`.
- **tarball channel**: `pnpm pack` in this repo, then `dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-mcp-panel-<version>.tgz`.
- **uninstall**: remove the `mcp-panel` row from `cordis.patch.yml` (the web surface hot-reloads it), delete the package from the profile's `node_modules`, and verify with `dsh web --dump-config` that no `mcp-panel` row remains.

## Configuration

All tunables are Schemastery `Config` fields (changeable from cordis.yml). `cordis.patch.yml` documents the common keys inline; the full key list lives in the table below.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `probeEnabled` | `true` | Register the `mcp_probe` background-job tool (panel-only results) |
| `probeTimeoutMs` | `10000` | Per-probe timeout in ms |
| `maxProbes` | `10` | Probe records shown in the panel |
| `refreshIntervalMs` | `0` | Suggested panel refresh in ms; `0` = on demand |
| `outputLanguage` | `en` | `/mcp` output language: `en \| zh \| es \| pt \| hi` |
| `passiveProbeEnabled` | `false` | Periodically probe streamable-http servers |
| `passiveProbeIntervalMs` | `60000` | Passive probe interval in ms |
| `trialEnabled` | `true` | Tool trial console (settings tab + `/mcp call`) |
| `trialTimeoutMs` | `120000` | Panel-side deadline per trial call in ms |
| `trialMaxResultChars` | `60000` | Cap on the trial result payload in chars |
| `writeEnabled` | `true` | Kill switch: `false` rejects every profile write (copy still works) |
| `writeVerifyEnabled` | `true` | Re-verify each write against the loader's re-applied state before reporting success |
| `writeVerifyTimeoutMs` | `3000` | Polling budget for write verification in ms |
| `backupCount` | `5` | `cordis.patch.yml` backups retained per write |
| `catalogEntries` | `[]` | User overlay for the recommended server directory: entries append, an entry with the same `id` replaces the built-in one |

Claude requests omit `mcp_probe`; other providers retain it when enabled. Configured MCP tools and manual panel probes remain available. Switching providers takes effect on the next request.

## Tools & surfaces

| Surface | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/mcp` | command | Per-server status row; model-readable and log-reconstructable |
| `/mcp <server> tools` | command | Model-visible `mcp__*` tool names + descriptions |
| `/mcp <server> health` | command | Derived self-heal suggestions from sanitized error text |
| `/mcp <server> disable` / `enable` | command | Toggle one server row in the profile patch |
| `/mcp <server> probe` | command | One Streamable HTTP connectivity probe (background job) |
| `/mcp <server> call <tool> [json]` | command | Trial-call through the official tool pipeline |
| `mcp_probe` | tool | Optional Streamable HTTP connectivity probe (background job) |
| Settings → Plugins → MCP tab | UI slot | Status cards, server CRUD, and the tool trial console |
| `mcpPanel` Typert Remote | service | Read-only snapshot channel (host → client) |

## Resources & Prompts

Resources ARE bridged upstream: the base bundle mounts `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-resources`, the official client registers each connection's resource provider into `ctx.mcpResources`, and that package owns the three shared tools (`list_mcp_resources`, `list_mcp_resource_templates`, `read_mcp_resource`). The console feature-detects the service and the registered tools, and offers a read-only Resources browser (list / templates / URI read) on every server card — each call runs through the OFFICIAL tool pipeline, and results never enter model context.

MCP **prompt templates** and **resource subscriptions** remain deferred upstream; the capabilities board marks Prompts **pending upstream support**.

## Permissions & data

- **Permissions**: the `dshWorkshop` manifest declares `network:outbound` and `native-code:none`.
- **Data**: the panel is read-only; it writes only append-only `cordis.patch.yml` fragments (approval-gated, backup-first). URL query credentials, userinfo passwords, header values, bearer tokens, and JWTs are redacted before rendering; configured `headers` never enter any snapshot, and env/header **values** never leave the host (the editor sees keys only).

## Security boundaries

- **The bridge stays the bridge.** No transport, OAuth, or protocol changes; one mcp-client row per server, exactly as hand-written.
- **No fake status.** Connection fields without upstream observations read `unknown` / `—` with `statusSource: 'derived'`; exit codes and stderr tails are never invented.
- **Writes are append-only, approval-gated, and backed up.** The console never rewrites `cordis.patch.yml`; it appends generated operations, keeps the newest `backupCount` backups, and re-verifies every write against the loader's re-applied state before reporting success (a skipped patch never reads as success).
- **No prompt injection.** The panel registers **no prompt sections**; its only model-facing text is the two tool/command descriptions.

## Known limitations

- **Prompt templates & resource subscriptions** are pending upstream support — the official client bridges tools and resources, but not prompts or subscriptions.
- **Exit codes / stderr tails** are labeled *pending upstream support* until the client exposes them.
- **Read-only panel** — the console never fakes a connection state; unobservable fields read `unknown` / `-1` / `—`.
- **Writes are verified, not guaranteed** — the console re-verifies each write against the loader's re-applied state and fails honestly when the loader did not apply it (e.g. a row inserted by `$DSH_HOME/cordis.patch.yml`, which a profile-layer patch cannot reach).

## Development

```sh
pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run typecheck:ci && pnpm test && pnpm run build && pnpm run verify:self-contained && pnpm run verify:artifacts && pnpm pack
```

`scripts/verify-headless.mjs` boots the real web profile and prints the exact `/mcp` output. Releases: `node scripts/release.mjs <x.y.z>` runs the full gate, commits, and tags `v<x.y.z>` locally (never pushes).
