/**
 * Profile patch-layer writes for the console. APPEND-ONLY by design: the
 * console never rewrites `cordis.patch.yml` — it appends one generated
 * operation block at a time, after copying the current file to a timestamped
 * backup. The Loader applies patch lists in order, so an appended operation
 * is the effective configuration; user comments and unrelated rows stay
 * byte-for-byte untouched. Backups are pruned to the newest `backupCount`.
 *
 * Every write is reversible: the backup restores the previous state, and an
 * appended block can be hand-removed to undo.
 *
 * The one exception is {@link rewritePatchFile}: a real delete has to take
 * the entry's operations out of the file, which no append can express. It
 * backs up first like every other write and only ever receives text the
 * prune module produced (whole-line removals, verified as a line-subsequence
 * of the current file).
